Welcome to the **MLPerf Automations and Scripts** repository! This repository provides tools, automations, and scripts to facilitate running MLPerf benchmarks, with a primary focus on **MLPerf Inference benchmarks**.

The automations build upon and extend the powerful [Collective Mind (CM) script automations](https://github.com/mlcommons/cm4mlops/tree/main/automation/script) to streamline benchmarking and workflow processes.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Automated Benchmarking** ‚Äì Simplifies running MLPerf Inference benchmarks with minimal manual intervention.
- **Modular and Extensible** ‚Äì Easily extend the scripts to support additional benchmarks and configurations.
- **Seamless Integration** ‚Äì Compatible with Docker, cloud environments, and local machines.
- **Collective Mind (CM) Integration** ‚Äì Utilizes the CM framework to enhance reproducibility and automation.

## üß∞ Collective Mind (CM) Automations

The **Collective Mind (CM)** framework is a Python-based package offering both CLI and API support for creating and managing automations. CM automations enhance ML workflows by simplifying complex tasks such as Docker container management and caching.

### Core Automations
- **Script Automation** ‚Äì Automates script execution across different environments.
- **Cache Management** ‚Äì Manages reusable cached results to accelerate workflow processes.

Learn more about CM in the [CM4MLOps documentation](https://github.com/mlcommons/cm4mlops).
